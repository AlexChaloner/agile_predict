# Agile Predict v1.0.0

This model forecasts Octopus Agile electricity prices up to 14 days in advance using a Machine Learning model trained on data from the Balancing Mechanism Reporting System (BRMS), National Grid Electricity Supply Operator (NG ESO) and weather data from open-meteo.com.

Because the app is hosted on a fly.io hobby account the database is only updated when the page is accessed and if there has been an hour since the last update. This may sometimes cause slight delays in loading.
